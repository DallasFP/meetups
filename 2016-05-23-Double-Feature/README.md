Double Feature with Jonathan

Part 1) A Project in F#, OCaml, and Haskell - Experiences & Lessons Learned In
this short session I'd like to share my experience with having implemented the
same project in F#, OCaml, and Haskell. I will cover the tooling, libraries, and
some code/design patterns used in each eco-system.

Part 2) Composing an application in Haskell using Monad Transformers In this
session we will cover how to model and implement the beginnings of a server-side
application in Haskell. We will incrementally cover monad transformers and see
how they can help with composing functionality to build an application. If you
would like to get a head start on Monad Transformers please have a look at
